<img src="../static/img/about_profile.jpg" align="left" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT="50%" Hspace="20" Vspace="20" ><p>Hello, my Name is Stephan and I am a German currently in NYC. I work at Rockefeller University where our group works on understanding visual processing in the brain. We are interested in measuring the activity of thousand of neurons and their connections in real time. As this is a very novel and techonolgically challenging approach, many technologies need to be invented and fine tuned along the way.</p>
<p>I did my PhD in pioneering lab of Winfried Denk at the Max Planck Society in Germany, one of the fathers of modern technologies in System Neuroscience. I was designing software and hardware that did not exist at the time to allow us to look into the brains of behaving animals. I used Java, Wavemetrics Igor and Matlab at that time. </p>

<p>Moving on to The Rockefeller University the technological hurdles became more difficult and invovled. I developed many hardware and software solutions, involving the collection of data with numorous sensors as well as the data handling. For latter I wrote several software packages involving image maninpulation, data processing and plotting, database handling and machine learning. Most of this work was done in Python and Matlab and a little in C++. Look at my Github page for a few examples but many projects are not on Github. 
I worked in Software development for now over 10 years and I only added the recent stuff on Github.</p>
<p>I am currently interested in Software development, data science and I am somewhat also getting into Front and Back End development.
I do also enjoy the teamwork, either at my current work with students and colleages alike, as well as online using Github. I try to contribute to the community by making most of my code open source and available, as well as help people out at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/5174573/ninehundred">Stack Overflow</a> (see toolbar on top).</p>
<p>
Feel free to contact me with any question you might have.</p>
