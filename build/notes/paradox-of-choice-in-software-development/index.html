    <h1>Paradox of Choice In Software Development</h1>

    <p>Starting a software project can be daunting. From laying out the specifications, to choosing a framework and coming up with a customer acquisition strategy - the task often seems insurmountable. This can lead to analysis paralysis, which in turn can lead to valuable time and resources being wasted, or the project never being completed.</p>
<p>This phenomenon, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice">paradox of choice</a> that was popularized by psychologist Barry Schwartz argues that while choice improves the quality of our lives, too much choice can actually have negative psychological effects. In his book, Schwartz illustrates how many choices we actually have with a trip to the supermarket. At the supermarket, he found there were: 285 varieties of cookies, 75 iced teas, 120 different pasta sauces, and more.</p>
<p>Though Schwartz uses the supermarket to illustrate his point, we can do the same with software development tools. Lets say you are looking to build a web application. First you have to decide which language, or more importantly, which framework, you want to use. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks">Wikipedia</a> lists 130 options for web application frameworks. And that is just the start - you also have to decide on a template language, CoffeeScript vs JavaScript, Sass vs Less, and so on.</p>
<p>All of this choice can be extremely off putting, especially to novice developers. If I had have known all of the choices I would have to make before I even started creating my application, I doubt I would have pursued programming. Even for intermediate and advanced developers, having to make all of these choices can lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue">decision fatigue</a>, which can in turn lead to burn out and a failed project.</p>
<p>So, what can be done to combat the feeling of being overloaded with choice? Is it all hopeless? Not quite. There are a few tips to prevent becoming overwhelmed. The first tip I have to offer is choose what you are familiar with. More times than not, that familiarity will make you more productive than x feature in y new framework or tool. When I am creating a new web application, my stack looks like this: Python, Django, Coffeescript, Backbone/Marionette, Sass, and Gulp. While Rails may hold some advantages over Django, I am more familiar with Python, so I am able to be more productive than I would be working with a language I am not as good with. Create a standard stack and stick with it, but also be continuously experimenting with new components, just not with important projects.</p>
<p>In addition to standardizing your stack, you should make the least amount of decisions necessary to get started. Don't try and figure out everything at the beginning. Instead, get your hands dirty and start building as soon as possible. Make decisions as you go. This reduces stress and allows you to make more informed decisions, as your requirements and ideas are guaranteed to change once you start developing.</p>
<p>The last tip I have to overcome the paradox of choice is to simplify. When planning your project, choose your top 5 features you need for your application to be successful, and eliminate 1 or 2. That's all the planning you need. If you are a novice developer, use a monolithic design pattern, don't worry about picking up a new paradigm just yet. There is plenty of time to figure that out later. Do the bare minimum, stay lean, and iterate quickly. Don't let choice stand in your way.</p>
