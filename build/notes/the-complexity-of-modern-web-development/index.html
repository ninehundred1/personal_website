    <p>Web development has become too complex. So much so, that if I were a new programmer looking to get into web development, I feel like I would be too intimidated to even try. When I started programming, I made my first website using vanilla PHP, HTML, and CSS. But with the rise of web development frameworks, new design paradigms, template languages, build systems, and more, the barrier to entry seems to be higher than ever. </p>
<p>The shear amount of knowledge a web developer (read: full stack developer) is expected to have is almost insane. For most jobs, you are required to have knowledge of a back end framework like Rails or Django, a JavaScript MVC framework like Angular or Backbone, knowledge of HTML and the HTML5 API, experience with CSS and CSS preprocessors like LESS or Sass, knowledge of build systems like Gulp and Grunt, AWS experience, and DevOps experience, all on top of general algorithms and design patterns knowledge. While most experienced developers will have at least some experience with most of those technologies, it is very unlikely a novice developer will have even heard of most of them let alone had experience actually using them. </p>
<p>And it doesn't seem like things are going to be getting simpler anytime soon. New frameworks and concepts are being introduced daily, and more and more technologies are being added to the "standard" web stack. As a web developer who typically works on projects independently, I would like to be able to simplify my stack rather than keep adding more layers of complexity, which just adds more opportunity for things to go wrong.</p>
<p>That's not too say the future looks all grim. Services like <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> undoubtedly make a developer's life easier. The rise in popularity of Node.js now makes it possible to write both the front and back end of your app in JavaScript. Hell, some people are even writing <a href="https://github.com/krasimir/absurd">HTML and CSS</a> in JavaScript.</p>
<p>I think we will start to see the "single language stack" begin to rise in popularity, as it saves money for businesses and lowers the barrier to entry for new developers. I'm excited to see what new ideas begin to pop up as some of the single language stack tools begin to mature. What tools do you use to simplify your web development workflow?
